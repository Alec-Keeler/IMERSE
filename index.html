        <p>Learning to read micro-expressions bears with it a certain responsibility, and the ethics of learning to read emotions someone may not want to show you should be seriously considered.  IMERSE is intended to be used by those who have difficulty with interpersonal relationships due to an impaired ability (for any reason) to understand social cues based on the emotional reactions of those around them.  You can read more about the ethics of learning this skill from Dr. Paul Ekman <a href='https://www.paulekman.com/blog/dangers-reading-micro-expressions/'>on his site here</a>.</p>
